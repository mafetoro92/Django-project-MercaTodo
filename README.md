# Django-project-MercaTodo

This project is focused on creating a **REST API** with **Django**, **Python** and **MySQL**. The products that we store in MySQL are market products. We apply the **HTTP protocol **together with the** GET, POST, PUT and DELETE** methods and the JSON format to send and receive data. 
In you want to see the API check the link below.
